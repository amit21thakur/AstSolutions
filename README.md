# AstSolutions
Coding exercise for AST Solutions

Questions 1 to 4 is implemented in this repository.

I have written a single implementation for removing duplicate characters. From my perspective, that's the best solution I can think off at this point in time. It has a complexity of n. It was hard for me to write the other implementations which were not the better solution as compared to the one I just implemented.

I have skipped implementing the front end exercise and that would have taken more time. Instead, I am sharing other repo which I build recently for another coding exercise. https://github.com/amit21thakur/SixPivot (This is an application made with .NET core and Angular as a front end) - Just open the solution in VS 2019 and run it.

I have also implemented Unit Test Cases for the methods implemented.
